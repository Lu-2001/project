                        <p class="need-hidden"> Welcome to Fundamental of Web Development. This textbook is intended to cover the broad range of topics required for modern web development and is suitable for intermediate to upper-level computing students.
                            A significant percent-age of the material in this book has also been used by the authors to teach web development principles to first-year computing students and to non-computing students as well.
                            Testers are the people who try to identify flaws in software before it gets released. This type of work is often called quality assurance (QA). Although some test roles are for nonexperts, many testers know how to program and might write automated tests as well as develop testing plans from requirements. Although these duties are often integrated with developers, they can form a job all their own.
                            Websites are complicated projects often involving the work of many different people with different skill sets and personalities. Getting all these people to work together in a timely and effective manner typically requires the committed effort and knowledge of project managers (also called product managers). Knowledge of planning and estimation methodologies is helpful, as are more general people management skills.
                            A major factor to consider when thinking about a career in web development is what kind of company you want to work for. Sure, everyone needs a website, but there are multiple kinds of companies that work together to make that a possibility
                            Design companies are at the opposite end of the spectrum, with few technical positions available. These firms will provide professional artistic and design services that might go beyond the web and include logos and branding in general.
